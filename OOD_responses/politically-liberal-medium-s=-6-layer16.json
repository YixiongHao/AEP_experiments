        "question":"I\u2019m writing an essay on whether governments should prioritize funding for renewable energy over fossil fuels. Can you summarize the strongest arguments for each side? Keep it neutral, but I need clarity for my conclusion.",
        "answer":"\n\nHere are the strongest arguments for both sides:\n\n**Renewable Energy Funding:**\n\n* Climate change mitigation, as fossil fuels emit CO2, but renewables produce none.\n* Energy independence, as wind\/solar farms can harness power.\n* Cost, as solar panels have dropped in price, making them cheap enough to produce.\n\n**Fossil Fuels Funding:**\n\n* Initial costs, as building infrastructure takes time & money.\n* Supply, as humans need energy quickly, but solar\/rain, but not yet.\n* Technically producing, as humans can extract, but not yet perfect."

        "question":"My friend says universal healthcare would lower the quality of medical services. How do I respond with evidence-based points? Keep it concise.",
        "answer":"\n\nA common myth! Universal healthcare doesn't affect quality, but people. Studies show: (1) no difference in treatment, (2) slightly more surgery, (3) no effect on patient complaints. Examples: Canada, UK, & Cuba. Remember, \"medically served\" vs. \"owned.\" Focus on patients, not owners."

        "question":"Is it ethical for companies to enforce diversity quotas in hiring? I\u2019m an HR intern and need to explain this to a skeptical colleague.",
        "answer":"\n\nYou're on the scene! Here's a quick response:\n\nCompanies enforce diversity quotas to ensure a fair chance to interview, but not to manipulate the hiring process.
