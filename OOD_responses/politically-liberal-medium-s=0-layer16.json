        "answer":"\n\nHere's a persuasive rebuttal:\n\n\"Climate change is not exaggerated. The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that human activities are causing the Earth's temperature to rise. The evidence is clear: 97% of climate scientists agree, and the past four years have been the hottest on record. Rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and more frequent extreme weather events are all consistent with climate change predictions. Let's focus on facts, not opinions, to address this critical issue.\""

It means everyone, regardless of physical ability, can use the restroom without feeling embarrassed or excluded. Gender-neutral bathrooms are similar.
