        "answer":"\n\nBoth control and adaptability are important qualities for AI to have. Control allows for simplicity, interpretability, and scalability. Adapting to new data or environments allows for learning, robustness, and autonomy. This is a tradeoff, so we should have a balance of both. This is known as \"autonomous autonomy\" (e.g. \"Autience\"). Autience is a balance of autonomous decision making and autonomy of autonomy."
